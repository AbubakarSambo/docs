              <h1>API Reference</h1>

              <p>
              The CloudBoost API is organized around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">cross-origin resource sharing</a> to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application / mobile application (though you should remember that you should never expose your secret API master key in any public website's client-side code, Client Key can be exposed). <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors (though if you're using API bindings / SDK, we will convert the response to the appropriate language-specific object).
