              In Cloudboost, you create an app each of which has its own AppID, Java 
              Client Key and the Master Key that you apply to your web app. You master key is a secret which should not be shared in your client apps. Your account on CloudBoost can accommodate multiple apps.

              This is useful even if you have one application, since you can deploy different versions for test and production.
